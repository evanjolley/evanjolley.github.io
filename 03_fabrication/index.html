<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I really had no idea what I wanted to do for this project. It left me very demoralized at points. All of the ideas I had seemed too far fetched, I was struggling with other classes, and had some stuff going on outside of school. So my art isn't as cool as I would maybe like it, but I'm happy that I got this done.
<p class = "margin"></p>
I began by printing a few gears to try to give myself inspiration. I used the GF Gear Generator Fusion extension to make them. While moving them around, I positioned five of them like the Olympic rings. This was my inspiration.

I printed new gears with cutouts to make them look like rings. Not perfect, but better than solid. I just use the straightline tool and a circle to make these pseudo-triangles.

I wanted to make some fun Team USA themed decorations for this sculpture.
<p class = "margin"></p>
First, I printed out some USA flags of course. I wanted to do the "cut" layer for both the stars and stripes so that it would be visible for both sides. Due to how small the stars are, several small fires were started because of this. So the stars are scored and the stripes are cut.

As for the faces, I turned coloring book pages of four Olympic athletes into SVGs. The four athletes I chose were Michael Phelps, Simone Biles, Shaun White, and Lebron James. I was going to do Serena Williams, but the file somehow corrupted and I figured it was ok to do two on each side.

I wanted the base to also be patriotic. I chose an outline of the US for the bottom right and the classic "We the people" for the top left, both "cut."
<p class = "margin"></p>

I measured the holes to make sure the axles were in the correct places for the gears to interlock. I cut a piece of scrap material first to make sure I had cut them correctly.

Here I began to lay the gear in the olympic patte and get a feel for how it would come together.

<p class = "margin"></p>

I made the athletes spin around the bottom two gears, and I made the outside two axles into flag poles for my American flags.

And after adding a motor to the center gear, I had my moving sculpture. It represents the industriousness of the American people, and our never-ending drive for success. No amount of hours spent at the laser cutter will slow us down!!!
