I printed a soap dish for my shower!
<p class="margin">   </p>

My shower in Currier has a built in soap dish, but after years of use it's gotten kind of gross. I have tried scurbbing it out. Even still, the bottom of my white soap turns blue every time! It is infuriating.
<p class="margin">   </p>

Several weeks ago, while showering, I thought to myself that I would use the lab to print out a soap dish that hooks onto a bar across the preexisting one. This assignment turned out to be the perfect excuse to do just that!
<p class="margin">   </p>

I pulled a .stl file of a soap dish from Thingiverse to get myself started. Check it out <a target="_blank" href='https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5254836/files'>here</a>.

Then, I put it into Fusion and added the clip that will slide over the bar of the existing holder. I took measurements of the bar using a caliper.

Finally, I added it to Prusa Slicer, added supports, and started the print! Here are my files!

I really fell in love with 3D printing this week. I printed a total of 4 things. The other things I printed were a shot glass that looks like a Stanley, an Among Us Figure, and the Elder Wand.

The object that I scanned was a stick of Old Spice deodorant.

I was curious to see how the scanner would do picking up the smooth contours, and it did great!

This part tested my patience. I tried scanning a hammer, scissors, wire cutters, my hand, and my notebook, all with varying, but tiny, levels of success.

I've noticed myself getting upset with not being able to get some things in this class correct right away, so I'm focusing my efforst going forward on chilling out and not being so stressed B)

With some of my downtime between finals at the end of the semester, I would like to return here and scan my head and make a bust.
