<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Habit Tracker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="../habits.png" alt="habits image" style="max-width: 400px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build something on my wall that will keep track of my habits. It will physically display how well I have been keeping my habits.
<br>
<br>
My habits will be arranged vertically, each followed by seven segment displays showing my current daily streak and my high score.
<br>
<br>
Every night I will get a text asking how I have done following each of my habits. I will respond, and the counters will be either incremented up or returned to 0.

<h4>Idea 2: Personal Alexa</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./alexa.jpg" alt="alexa image" style="max-width: 400px;">

I want to build a personal assistant that can sit on my desk and respond to natural language commands, similar to Amazon's Alexa.
<br>
<br>
I use Siri quite a bit and am continually annoyed with the results.
<br>
<br>
I would like to build a small box that can check the weather, add things to my gcal, remind me of things, and control lights, all through natural language commands.

<h4>Idea 3: The best alarm clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./clock.jpg" alt="clock image" style="max-width: 400px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build an alarm clock that won't shut off until I have completed certain tasks.
<br>
<br>
A RNG can determine what task I must do on any given day.
<br>
<br>
For example, it could use computer vision to watch me do push ups, a weight sensor to have me stand for a certain amount of time, audio input to ask me math questions, etc.
