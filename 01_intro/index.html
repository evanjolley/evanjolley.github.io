<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Habit Tracker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="../habits.png" alt="habits image">
<br>
I want to build something on my wall that will keep track of my habits. It will physically display how well I have been keeping my habits.
<br>
<br>
My habits will be arranged vertically, each followed by a seven segment displays showing my current daily streak and my high score.
<br>
<br>
Every night I will get a text asking how I have done following each of my habits. I will respond, and the counters will be either incremented up or returned to 0.

<h4>Idea 2: Personal Alexa</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to build a personal assistant that can sit on my desk and respond to natural language commands, similar to Amazon's Alexa.

<h4>Idea 3: The best alarm clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I want to build an alarm clock that won't shut off until I have completed certain tasks such as push ups, standing for a certain amount of time, answering math questions, etc.
