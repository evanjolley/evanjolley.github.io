<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Habit Tracker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="../habits.png" alt="habits image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build something on my wall that will keep track of my habits. It will physically display how well I have been keeping my habits.
<br>
<br>
My habits will be arranged vertically, each followed by seven segment displays showing my current daily streak and my high score.
<br>
<br>
Every night I will get a text asking how I have done following each of my habits. I will respond, and the counters will be either incremented up or returned to 0.
<br>
<br>
I could also see myself doing a similar thing for budgeting. It would start as a green $x00 number at the beginning of a month and slowly iterate down as more charges were put on my credit card.

<h4>Idea 2: LDR Communications</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./ldr.png" alt="ldr image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build something that can help me and my long distance girlfriend communicate in a cute way.
<br>
<br>
I am imagining sending texts to a number, and those same texts are displayed on her message board in her room.
<br>
<br>
The opposite would also be possible, with her sending messages to mine.

<h4>Idea 3: xxx</h4>

<h4>Idea 4: The best alarm clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./clock.jpg" alt="clock image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build an alarm clock that won't shut off until I have completed certain tasks.
<br>
<br>
A RNG can determine what task I must do on any given day.
<br>
<br>
For example, it could use computer vision to watch me do push ups, a weight sensor to have me stand for a certain amount of time, audio input to ask me math questions, etc.
