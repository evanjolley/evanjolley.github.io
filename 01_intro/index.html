<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are 3 ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Habit Tracker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="../habits.png" alt="habits image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
Some habits I can keep easily. Some I struggle with greatly. I recently read the book Atomic Habits and learned that rigorously keeping track of how well you stick to habits can have a positive impact on if you keep them or not.
<br>
<br>
Thus, I want to build something for my wall that will keep track of my habits. It will physically display how well I have been keeping the habits for the whole world to see.
<br>
<br>
My initial idea is that my habits will be arranged vertically, each followed by seven segment displays showing my current daily streak and my high score. I believe that 3 digits is most likely sufficient, but hey, maybe I'll be using this in four years.
<br>
<br>
Every night I will get a text asking how I have done following each of my habits. I will respond, and the counters will be either incremented up or returned to 0. I'm sure there are some APIs I can use to send myself messages and communicate with the board. I am unfamiliar with the technology, however, so I have much to learn.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I could also see myself doing a similar project for budgeting. It would start as a green $x00 number at the beginning of a month and slowly iterate down as more charges were put on my credit card.
<br>
<br>
Eventually I might go into the red, and be left with a negative balance. The number displayed at the end of the month, whether positive or negative, will be added to next month's total.

<h4>Idea 2: LDR Communications</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./ldr.png" alt="ldr image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build something that can help me and my long distance girlfriend communicate in a cute way. When I leave Harvard in December she will still have another semester.
<br>
<br>
I am imagining sending texts to a number, and those same texts are displayed on a message board in her room. Some sort of display that can handle text.
<br>
<br>
<img src="./message.png" alt="message image" style="max-width: 400px;">
<br>
<br>
The opposite would also be possible, with her sending messages to mine.
<br>
<br>
This game of telephone would provide us with a cute way of leaving messages for each other, reminding each other of things, and staying connected in a new way.

<h4>Idea 3: Shoe Computer</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./shoe_comp.jpg" alt="shoe image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
This is probably my most ambitious idea and the one I am most excited about. I would love to put a computer in my shoe. The thing is, I really don't know what I would want to use it for.
<br>
<br>
I am imagining something that looks like the above. I could then have a minimum of four inputs -- the heel and toe of both foot. Doing different stomping patterns or orientations could lead to specific outputs.
<br>
<br>
That being said, I am still trying to come up with those outputs.
<br>
<br>
<img src="./whoop.jpg" alt="whoop image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I could turn it into a fitness wearable? Or something to track steps or gait?
<br>
<br>
<img src="./morse.jpg" alt="morse image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
Maybe I could learn morse code and be able to text with my shoes?
<br>
<br>
I am still brainstorming!

<h3>Idea graveyard:</h3>
<br>
<h4>Idea: Mega fork</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I have been eating too quickly. I want to make myself a fork that can help me slow down.
<br>
<br>
My idea is for a fork that shocks you if A. it is not set down every once in a while and B. it is holding too much weight.
<br>
<br>
I honestly have no idea how to build this whatsoever, but I would love to give it a try!
<br>
<br>
<img src="./gum.png" alt="gum image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
Have you ever used one of these? This is the sort of sensation I will shoot for in my vibrating spoon -- not painful, but uncomfortable to hold.
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea: The best alarm clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<img src="./clock.jpg" alt="clock image" style="max-width: 250px;">
<br>
<br>
I want to build an alarm clock that won't shut off until I have completed certain tasks.
<br>
<br>
A random number generator can determine what task I must do on any given day.
<br>
<br>
For example, it could use computer vision to watch me do push ups, a weight sensor to have me stand for a certain amount of time, audio input to ask me math questions, etc.
<br>
<br>
I believe I would be able to implement several different ways to turn the alarm off, keeping myself guessing and insuring I always wake up on time for class.
